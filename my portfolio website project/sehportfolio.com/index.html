                            I have completed various java-based projects.This is my Java based Project "Hospital-and-Health-Care-Management-System.
                            It contains the doctor-patient table with all records. for example, Doctor name, Timing, speciality, and availability. 
                            First this project will show you the main menu. In the main menu, It will show you six tables. In this project, I have created six tables. 
                            1st table name is "DOCTOR SECTION", 2nd table name is "PATIENT SECTION", 3rd table name is "MEDICINE SECTION", 4th table name is "LABORATORY SECTION",
                            5th table name is "HOSPITAL FACILITY SECTION" and 6th table name is "STAFF SECTION". I have already saved some data in each table. 
                            For example, In this project when you will select "1" for doctor table then it will show you two options: "1" is "Add New Entry" and "2" is
                            "Existing Doctors List" Now, If you will click on "1" then you can Add New Entry and if you will click on "2" then it will show you Existing Doctors
                            List. This is my complete Hospital and Health Care Management System Project in Java with source code and pictures. This project is very interesting.
                            So, now you can download it, run it on your computer and you can able to modify it.<br>

                            from colliding with other cars. This game consists of single level. First, download the project and extract it. When you are done extracting the folder, make sure 
                            you have your JDK set up to correct path. When you run the game, you will see your car moving on the road. You can select the start button to play the game.
                            You cannot select different variety of cars to go into the race. Your arrows are the controller for this game. You have to just press the arrows to the adjacent
                            sides to switch over the side. So that you prevent yourself from hitting the other objects and cars. This is my complete Car game project in Java with source code

                            coding on C++
                            My final year project in bachelors was “Biometric Security System” implementing a fingerprint detection System through microcontroller by burning “C++” code on 
                            a Microcontroller chip. Microcontroller, LCD, KEYPAD,Buzzer, LED, fingerprint module, relay, step down transformer, capacitors, transistors, switches, wires,
                            crystal of 11.9 HZ frequency, EEPROM are the hardware components which was used in my FYP project. I worked on the C++ code for the microcontroller in this project. 
                            So according to the C++ code when this project runs then Microcontroller will verify digital code which comes from fingerprint module if it is correct or not, if it is
                            correct then it will take second input from fingerprint module and verify it into microcontroller memory if it is correct then it will show on LCD it is verified and 
                            lock will be open, while in not condition it shows on the LCD that it is not verified, buzzer will give the sound beep and lock will remain close. It can store nearly 
                            900 fingers data. It can be used in banks, companies, homes and many more places. It is small in size and implements good security for accessing the security zone.
