# My-Portfolio-Website-Project

I have completed various HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript projects. One of my favorite HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript project is "My Portfolio Website". It is a Portfolio Website Using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. It is a Complete Responsive Website Design.

It have five main sections. First is a header or home section. When you open this Portfolio Website then you will see the header or home section. When you click on about section then it will open the "about me" details. In the "about me" there are three more sections, 1st is "Skills" section, 2nd is "Projects" section and 3rd is "Education" section. In the about section, you can see 1st is "Skills" section when you will click on "Projects" section then it will open my "Projects" details and when you will click on "Education" section then it will show you my education details  .When you click on "services" section then it will show you "My Services". When you click on "Portfolio" section then it will show you "My Work" details and finally When you click on "Contact" section then it will show you Contact Me form.
